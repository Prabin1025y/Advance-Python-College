They don’t teach you how to work with raw data, how to clean, and preprocess it. This creates a sizeable gap between the skills you need on the job and the abilities you have acquired in training. Truth be told, real-world data is messy, so you need to know how to overcome this obstacle to become an independent data professional.', 'The bootcamps we have seen online and even live classes neglect this aspect and show you how to work with ‘clean’ data. But this isn’t doing you a favour. In reality, it will set you back both when you are applying for jobs, and when you’re on the job.', 'The solution', 'Our goal is to provide you with complete preparation. And this course will turn you into a job-ready data analyst. To take you there, we will cover the following fundamental topics extensively.', 'Theory about the field of data analytics', 'Basic Python', 'Advanced Python', 'NumPy', 'Pandas', 'Working with text files', 'Data collection', 'Data cleaning', 'Data preprocessing', 'Data visualization', 'Final practical example', 'Each of these subjects builds on the previous ones. And this is precisely what makes our curriculum so valuable. Everything is shown in the right order and we guarantee that you are not going to get lost along the way, as we have provided all necessary steps in video (not a single one skipped). In other words, we are not going to teach you how to analyse data before you know how to gather and clean it.', 'So, to prepare you for the entry-level job that leads to a data science position - data analyst - we created The Data Analyst Course.', 'This is a rather unique training program because it teaches the fundamentals you need on the job. A frequently neglected aspect of vital importance.', 'Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course provides complete preparation for someone who wants to become a data analyst at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save). We believe that this resource will significantly boost your chances of landing a job, as it will prepare you for practical tasks and concepts that are frequently included in interviews.', 'The topics we will cover', '1. Theory about the field of data analytics', '2. Basic Python', '3. Advanced Python', '4. NumPy', '5. Pandas', '6. Working with text files', '7. Data collection', '8. Data cleaning', '9. Data preprocessing', '10. Data visualization', '11. Final practical example', '', '1. Theory about the field of data analytics', 'Here we will focus on the big picture. But don’t imagine long boring pages with terms you’ll have to check up in a dictionary every minute. Instead, this is where we want to define who a data analyst is, what they do, and how they create value for an organization.', 'Why learn it?', 'You need a general understanding to appreciate how every part of the course fits in with the rest of the content. As they say, if you know where you are going, chances are that you will eventually get there. And since data analyst and other data jobs are relatively new and constantly evolving, we want to provide you with a good grasp of the data analyst role specifically. Then, in the following chapters, we will teach you the actual tools you need to become a data analyst.', '2. Basic Python', 'This course is centred around Python. So, we’ll start from the very basics. Don’t be afraid if you do not have prior programming experience.', 'Why learn it?', 'You need to learn a programming language to take full advantage of the data-rich world we live in. Unless you are equipped with such a skill, you will always be dependent on other people’s ability to extract and manipulate data, and you want to be independent while doing analysis, right? Also, you don’t necessarily need to learn many programming languages at once. It is enough to be very skilled at just one, and we’ve naturally chosen Python which has established itself as the number one language for data analysis and data science (thanks to its rich libraries and versatility).', '3. Advanced Python', 'We will introduce advanced Python topics such as working with text data and using tools such as list comprehensions and anonymous functions.', 'Why learn it?', 'These lessons will turn you into a proficient Python user who is independent on the job. You will be able to use Python’s core strengths to your advantage. So, here it is not just about the topics, it is also about the depth in which we explore the most relevant Python tools.', '4. NumPy', 'NumPy is Python’s fundamental package for scientific computing. It has established itself as the go-to tool when you need to compute mathematical and statical operations.', 'Why learn it?', 'A large portion of a data analyst’s work is dedicated to preprocessing datasets. Unquestionably, this involves tons of mathematical and statistical techniques that NumPy is renowned for. In addition, the package introduces multi-dimensional array structures and provides a plethora of built-in functions and methods to use while working with them. In other words, NumPy can be described as a computationally stable state-of-the-art Python instrument that provides flexibility and can take your analysis to the next level.', '5. Pandas', 'The pandas library is one of the most popular Python tools that facilitate data manipulation and analysis. It is very valuable because you can use it to manipulate all sorts of information - numerical tables and time series data, as well as text.', 'Why learn it?', 'Pandas is the other main tool an analyst needs to clean and preprocess the data they are working with. Its data manipulation features are second to none in Python because of the diversity and richness it provides in terms of methods and functions. The combined ability to work with both NumPy and pandas is extremely powerful as the two libraries complement each other. You need to be capable to operate with both to produce a complete and consistent analysis independently.', '6. Working with text files', 'Exchanging information with text files is practically how we exchange information today. In this part of the course, we will use the Python, pandas, and NumPy tools learned earlier to give you the essentials you need when importing or saving data.', 'Why learn it?', 'In many courses, you are just given a dataset to practice your analytical and programming skills. However, we don’t want to close our eyes to reality, where converting a raw dataset from an external file into a workable Python format can be a massive challenge.', '7. Data collection', 'In the real world, you don’t always have the data readily available for you. In this part of the course, you will learn how to retrieve data from an API.', 'Why learn it?', 'You need to know how to source your data, right? To be a well-rounded analyst you must be able to collect data from outside sources. This is rarely a one-click process. This section aims at providing you with all the necessary tools to do that on your own.', '8. Data cleaning', 'The next logical step is to clean your data. This is where you will apply the pandas skills acquired earlier in practice. All lessons throughout the course have a real-world perspective.', 'Why learn it?', 'A large part of a data analyst’s job in the real world involves cleaning data and preparing it for the actual analysis. You can’t expect that you’ll deal with flawless data sources, right? So, it will be up to you to overcome this stage and clean your data.', '9. Data preprocessing', 'Even when your dataset is clean and in an understandable shape, it isn’t quite ready to be processed for visualizations and analysis just yet. There is a crucial step in between, and that’s data preprocessing.', 'Why learn it?', 'Data preprocessing is where a data analyst can demonstrate how good or great they are at their job. This stage of the work requires the ability to choose the right statistical tool that will improve the quality of your dataset and the knowledge to implement it with advanced pandas and NumPy techniques. Only when you’ve completed this step can you say that your dataset is preprocessed and ready for the next part, which is data visualization.', '10. Data visualization', 'Data visualization is the face of data. Many people look at the data and see nothing. The reason for that is that they are not creating good visualizations. Or even worse – they are creating nice graphs but cannot interpret them accurately.', 'Why learn it?', 'This part of the course will teach you how to use your data to produce meaningful insights. At the end of the day, data charts are what conveys the most information in the shortest amount of time. And nothing speaks better than a well crafted and meaningful data visualization.', '11. Practical example', 'The course contains plenty of exercises and practical cases. In the end, we have included a comprehensive practical example that will show you how everything you have learned along the way comes nicely together. This is where you will be able to appreciate how far you have come in your journey to becoming a data analyst and starting your data career.', 'What you get', 'A program worth $1,250', 'Active Q&A support', 'All the knowledge to become a data analyst', 'A community of aspiring data analysts', 'A certificate of completion', 'Access to frequent future updates', 'Real-world training', 'Get ready to become a data analyst from scratch', 'Why wait?

Andy strikes a nice balance with this course in that all the modules are broken up into easily digestible pieces. I like that he takes enough time to explain each new concept or module without being repetitive or using jargon that's difficult to follow. I also love being able to follow along with Andy as he explains each new module as well (as opposed to just talking off of slides all the time). He literally walks you through everything, so it's like you're right there looking over his shoulder. For anyone wanting to understand all the fundamentals of Wordpress, I think you'll absolutely love this course. It will save you tons of time by having all this information in one place. And you'll even learn some additional features like setting up affiliate links (not that everyone needs to know this but I like that Andy included it so it's there if you ever want to know). Truly a fantastic course!\xa0Lance Gross"", ""Superb Course - Extraordinary Instructor!!\xa0Andy's Wordpress for Beginners-Master Wordpress Quicky course is by far the best Wordpress course I've seen. And I definitely wouldn't say it's just for beginners. I'm not a beginner - I thought I knew Wordpress pretty well, but I learned SO MUCH MORE from this course! I've always had a lot of questions about the many settings and various options in Wordpress and most courses just skip over them or tell you to check this box and move on with no explanation. I never really got my questions answered until now. Andy is very detailed in his instruction. He walks you through step by step and tells you what each setting or section is for, how it is used (or not used) and why. I got more out of Andy's course than any other course I've ever taken. He has an extensive teaching background and it is evident in his clearly produced videos.

ROBUST STRUCTURE\xa0', 'The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.', ""That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning.\xa0With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning."", '2. INTUITION TUTORIALS\xa0', ""So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part:\xa0why you are doing what you are doing.\xa0And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive\xa0*feel*\xa0for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms."", 'With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level.

HANDS-ON CODING\xa0', 'In\xa0Deep Learning A-Z we code together with you.\xa0Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.', 'In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects.\xa0Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.', 'This is a course which naturally extends into your career.', '5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT\xa0', 'Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?', 'Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.', 'In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out.

Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.', 'So which is better and for what?', 'Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.', ""The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques."", '--- More\xa0Tools\xa0---\xa0', ""Theano\xa0is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it."", 'Keras\xa0is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code.

You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank."", 'Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.', 'If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.', '#2 Image Recognition\xa0', 'In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.', 'For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!', '#3\xa0Stock Price Prediction\xa0', 'In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to\xa0“Artificial Intelligence”. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.', 'The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.\xa0We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!', 'In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.', '#4\xa0Fraud Detection\xa0', 'According to a recent report published by Markets & Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.', 'This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.', 'This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.', '#5 & 6 Recommender Systems\xa0', ""From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet."", 'We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.', 'Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.', 'Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.', 'And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!', '---\xa0Summary\xa0---\xa0', 'In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.', 'We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!', 'Kirill &\xa0Hadelin', '']","['High school mathematics level', 'Basic Python programming knowledge']","['Understand the intuition behind Artificial Neural Networks', 'Apply Artificial Neural Networks in practice', 'Understand the intuition behind Convolutional Neural Networks', 'Apply Convolutional Neural Networks in practice', 'Understand the intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks', 'Apply Recurrent Neural Networks in practice', 'Understand the intuition behind Self-Organizing Maps', 'Apply Self-Organizing Maps in practice', 'Understand the intuition behind Boltzmann Machines', 'Apply Boltzmann Machines in practice', 'Understand the intuition behind AutoEncoders', 'Apply AutoEncoders in practice']","['Anyone interested in Deep Learning', 'Students who have at least high school knowledge in math and who want to start learning Deep Learning', 'Any intermediate level people who know the basics of Machine Learning or Deep Learning, including the classical algorithms like linear regression or logistic regression and more advanced topics like Artificial Neural Networks, but who want to learn more about it and explore all the different fields of Deep Learning', 'Anyone who is not that comfortable with coding but who is interested in Deep Learning and wants to apply it easily on datasets', 'Any students in college who want to start a career in Data Science', 'Any data analysts who want to level up in Deep Learning', 'Any people who are not satisfied with their job and who want to become a Data Scientist', 'Any people who want to create added value to their business by using powerful Deep Learning tools', 'Any business owners who want to understand how to leverage the Exponential technology of Deep Learning in their business', 'Any Entrepreneur who wants to create disruption in an industry using the most cutting edge Deep Learning algorithms']"

After working for several years with many excellent engineers, Dheeru realized that sometimes the teams he worked with fell short of developing effective solutions. This led to several rounds of ""code refactoring"" resulting in loss of valuable time for the organization. This he realized was due to programming not being taught in the right way at most Universities & Colleges across the world. Students are mostly taught only core programming language features without any emphasis on best practices or design rules required for writing well-designed, professional-level code. Due to this, developers are often ill-equipped when they have to come up with good solutions for complex problems. This leads to some quick ad-hoc & incomplete learning, which often not only result in bad solutions, but also more importantly causes lot of stress on developer\'s part. This made Dheeru realize that a more holistic approach to teaching is needed where programming language features are taught along with best practices & design principles needed for building well-designed robust software. This course is a result of this realization and it has taken him over 6 years of full-time effort (considered equivalent to over a decade if working part-time) in developing it.

After working for several years with many excellent engineers, Dheeru realized that sometimes the teams he worked with fell short of developing effective solutions. This led to several rounds of ""code refactoring"" resulting in loss of valuable time for the organization. This he realized was due to programming not being taught in the right way at most Universities & Colleges across the world. Students are mostly taught only core programming language features without any emphasis on best practices or design rules required for writing well-designed, professional-level code. Due to this, developers are often ill-equipped when they have to come up with good solutions for complex problems. This leads to some quick ad-hoc & incomplete learning, which often not only result in bad solutions, but also more importantly causes lot of stress on developer\'s part. This made Dheeru realize that a more holistic approach to teaching is needed where programming language features are taught along with best practices & design principles needed for building well-designed robust software. This course is a result of this realization and it has taken him over 6 years of full-time effort (considered equivalent to over a decade if working part-time) in developing it. He will continue to devote himself in building this course towards making it one of the best Java courses out there.']","[""The 3 P's: Passion, Patience, and Perseverance.
